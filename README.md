# BenthFun

This repository hosts the main `BenthFun project` documents. So far, it
is organized as follows:

1️⃣ [`Data`](https://github.com/JayCrlt/BenthFun/tree/main/Data) folder hosts the data Because the project will be split into two temporal seasons (i.e., between summer and after summer), you might find one subfolder for[`spring`](https://github.com/JayCrlt/BenthFun/tree/main/Data/Spring_2023) and another for fall (*coming soon...*). The spring season understands three majors experiments:

\- [`Transplant experiment`](https://github.com/JayCrlt/BenthFun/tree/main/Data/Spring_2023/Transplants) \
You might find 2 crucial documents: \
🧪 [`Alkalinity analyses`](https://github.com/JayCrlt/BenthFun/tree/main/Data/Spring_2023/Transplants/Alkalinity) \
🤿 [`Diving_log`](https://github.com/JayCrlt/BenthFun/tree/main/Data/Spring_2023) \

\- `Historic tiles` *coming soon...*

\- `PI Curves` *coming soon...*

2️⃣ [`Outputs`](https://github.com/JayCrlt/BenthFun/tree/main/Outputs) hosts the main outputs for further analyse.s \
Once again, you might find different sub-folders (i.e., main interesting figures, summary tables and intermediate outputs such as tables)

3️⃣ `R_Script` hosts the scripts used for the current analyses.\
So far, there are 4 scripts. The first one I worked on (i.e.,`Quality_Check_O2_Sensors.R`) allows me to check quickly if something is wrong with the O[2] measures. The two following scripts (i.e.,`Alkalinity -- T0.R` and `MiniDots. --T0.R`) do not deserved to be open. They will be sourced directly in the last script (i.e., `Viz – T0.R`) and be run silently to provides useful plots
